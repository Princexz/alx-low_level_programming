# File I/O

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX AFRICA SE School**. It aims to learn about how to handle files (open, close, read and write), file descriptors, system calls and file permissions in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-read_textfile.c` | Reads a text file and prints it to the `POSIX` standard output |
| `1-create_file.c` | Creates a file |
| `2-append_text_to_file.c` | Appends text at the end of a file |
| `3-cp.c` | Copies the content of a file to another file |
| `100-elf_header.c` | Displays the information contained in the `ELF` header at the start of an `ELF` file |

---

* Look for the right source of information online
* How to create, open, close, read and write files
* What are file descriptors
* What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their POSIX names
* How to use the I/O system calls open, close, read and write
* What are and how to use the flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR
* What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call
* What is a system call
* What is the difference between a function and a system call

### [0. Tread lightly, she is near](./0-read_textfile.c)
* Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.


### [1. Under the snow](./1-create_file.c)
* Create a function that creates a file.


### [2. Speak gently, she can hear](./2-append_text_to_file.c)
* Write a function that appends text at the end of a file.


### [3. cp](./3-cp.c)
* Write a program that copies the content of a file to another file.


### [4. elf](./100-elf_header.c)
* Write a program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.
