# Singly linked lists
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX AFRICA SE**. It aims to learn about linked lists in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-print_list.c` | Prints all the elements of a `list_t` list |
| `1-list_len.c` | Returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list |
| `2-add_node.c` | Adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list |
| `3-add_node_end.c` | Adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list |
| `4-free_list.c` | Frees a `list_t` list |
| `100-first.c` | Prints a message before main function is executed |
| `101-hello_holberton.asm` | Assembly code that prints `Hello, Holberton` only using `printf` function |


---

### [0. Print list](./0-print_list.c)
* Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.


### [1. List length](./1-list_len.c)
* Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.


### [2. Add node](./2-add_node.c)
* Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.


### [3. Add node at the end](./3-add_node_end.c)
* Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.


### [4. Free list](./4-free_list.c)
* Write a function that frees a list_t list.


### [5. The Hare and the Tortoise](./100-first.c)
* Write a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed. 


### [6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language](./101-hello_holberton.asm)
* Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
