# Structures, typedef
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Alx Africa**. It aims to learn about structures and `typedef` in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc `
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `dog.h` | Header file that contains a `struct dog` |
| `1-init_dog.c` | Initialize a variable of type `struct dog` |
| `2-print_dog.c` | Prints a `struct dog` |
| `3-islower.c` | Checks for lowercase character |
| `4-new_dog.c` | Creates a new dog |
| `5-free_dog.c` | Frees a dog |




### [0. Django](./dog.h)
* Define a new type struct dog 

### [1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself](./1-init_dog.c)
* Write a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog


### [2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad](./2-print_dog.c)
* Write a function that prints a struct dog


### [3. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read](./dog.h)
* Define a new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog.


### [4. A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of](./4-new_dog.c)
* Write a function that creates a new dog.


### [5. How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg](./5-free_dog.c)
* Write a function that frees dogs.
