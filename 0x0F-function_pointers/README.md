# Function pointers
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Africa SE**. It aims to learn about function pointers in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-print_name.c` | Prints a name |
| `1-array_iterator.c` | Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array |
| `2-int_index.c` | Searches for an integer |
| `3-calc.h` | Header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures |
| `3-op_functions.c` | File that contains functions that calculates arithmetic operations |
| `3-get_op_func.c` | Function pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions |
| `3-main.c` | Entry point |
| `100-main_opcodes.c` | Prints the opcodes of its own main function |

* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

---

### [0. What's my name](./0-print_name.c)
* Write a function that prints a name.


### [1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done](./1-array_iterator.c)
* Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.


### [2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities](./2-int_index.c)
* Write a function that searches for an integer.


### [3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at](./3-main.c)
* Write a program that performs simple operations.


### [4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker](./100-main_opcodes.c)
* Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
