# Preprocessor
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Africa SE**. It aims to learn about how to include guard in the header files and macros in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-object_like_macro.h` | Header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` |
| `1-pi.h` | Header file that defines a macro named `PI` |
| `2-main.c` | Prints the name of the file it was compiled from |
| `3-function_like_macro.h` | Function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x` |
| `4-sum.h` | Function-like macro `SUM(x,y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y` |
| `101-preprocessor_abuse.c` | Prints `Hello, Holberton` |

### [0. Object-like Macro](./0-object_like_macro.h)
* Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.


### [1. Pi](./1-pi.h)
* Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.


### [2. File name](./2-main.c)
* Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.


### [3. Function-like macro](./3-function_like_macro.h)
* Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.


### [4. SUM](./4-sum.h)
* Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.

### [6. Fun with the preprocessor](./101-preprocessor_abuse.c)
* Write a program that can print Hello, alx_africa, followed by a new line.
