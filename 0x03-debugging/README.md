Learning Objectives At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General What is debugging What are some methods of debugging manually How to read the error messages Copyright - Plagiarism You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives. You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work. You are not allowed to publish any content of this project. Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program. Requirements General Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 All your files should end with a new line Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

Tasks 0. Multiple mains mandatory In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project: Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function. You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.

Like, comment, subscribe mandatory Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code. You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task. That doesn’t seem right.

Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

Line count will not be checked for this task. You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31). You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).

0 > 972? This program prints the largest of three integers. That’s definitely not right.
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

Line count will not be checked for this task.

Leap year mandatory This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
