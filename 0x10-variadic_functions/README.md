# Variadic functions
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Africa SE**. It aims to learn about variadic functions in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-sum_them_all.c` | Returns the sum of all its parameters |
| `1-print_numbers.c` | Prints numbers |
| `2-print_strings.c` | Prints strings |
| `3-print_all.c` | Prints anything |

### [0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant](./0-sum_them_all.c)
* Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.


### [1. To be is to be the value of a variable](./1-print_numbers.c)
* Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.


### [2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable](./2-print_strings.c)
* Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.


### [3. To be is a to be the value of a variable](./3-print_all.c)
* Write a function that prints anything.


### [4. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language](./100-hello_holberton.asm)
* Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
