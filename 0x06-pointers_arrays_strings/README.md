0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
Practicing more pointers and arrays, this folder contains:

0-strcat.c: appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte. Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest.
1-strncat.c The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes . Return a pointer to the resulting string dest.
2-strncpy.c: function that copies a string.
3-strcmp.c: function that compares two strings.
4-rev_array.c: function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
5-string_toupper.c: function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6-cap_string.c: function that capitalizes all words of a string.
7-leet.c: function that encodes a string into 1337.
8-rot13.c function that encodes a string using rot13.
100-print_number.c function that prints an integer.
**101-magic.c: ** exercise about pointers.
